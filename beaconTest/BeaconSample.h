/*
 * Use struct inside double dictionary, just like BeaconDict
 * Considering: times seen and average distance of every beacon
 * Also need to remove beacons from other regions
 * Need to decide: dict structure (major, minor) -> (x, y, timesSeen, averageDistance) or (x, y) -> (timesSeen, averageDistance)
 *                 If we use the first structure, we may get rid of the BeaconDict, but a lot of code may need to be rewritten
 * Need to decide: sample interval (if sample interval is large, response is slow)
 * Maybe better to do this in C++
 * TODO: refactor: move all struct definition and functions, e.g. getCurTime to a single class named "util"
 * If this approach is better, we don't need refiner any more.
